# Project Movies

This project aimed to make a multi-page React application using an open movie API.


## Tools and techniques used: 💪🏼

HTML, CSS, JSX, React. Fetch, map, Route. I made the layout using flebox.

## My process: 🧠

When starting to work on the project I made a plan, dividing the project into different parts to make it more scaleable. My first focus was getting the different sites working using Route. After I made sure to fetch all the needed data from the API I was using. After that I started to work on the styling and breaking down the codes to different components. 
If I had more time with the project I would have made it responsive and also made an error-page (404 not found)
